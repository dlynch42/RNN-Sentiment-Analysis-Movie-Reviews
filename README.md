# RNN Sentiment Analysis Movie Reviews
 
Used a many-to-one architecture to construct an RNN for Sentimemt Analysis. Used the same dataset from the movie review classifier project. The first half of the dataset is training data and second half is for testing. Started with building the class constructor, then added build, train, and predict methods. I instantiated the SentimentRNN class and trained the model for 40 epochs using input from the training data. Last, used the model to prdcit the class labels on the test set as well as returning the prediciton probabilities.

(Model is not included for space but will be created if program is run)
